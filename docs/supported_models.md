# Supported Models

vllm-metal currently focuses on text-only language models on Apple Silicon. Multi-modal (vision / audio input) models are not yet supported.

## Text Pooling

Metal V1 has experimental text-only pooling support. See
[Text Pooling](text_embedding_pooling.md) for scope, usage, and
validation guidance.

| Model | Support | Runner | Evidence | Notes |

| mku64/Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B-mlx-8Bit | 🔵 | `pooling` / `classify` (paged) | `LLM.score(...)` -> `reranker-offline-score-ok 2`; `/score` -> HTTP 200 with two scalar scores | Revision `ba80418a47fa1c4368a6c2287b0e449904063576`; requires Qwen3 sequence-classification `hf_overrides` |

## Text-Only Language Models

`Automatic Prefix Cache` describes the default behavior when the user does
not pass `--enable-prefix-caching`. After
[#283](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal/pull/283), unified paged-KV
models on Metal can reuse shared prefixes by default. Upstream vLLM still
keeps the default off for hybrid/Mamba models, so those rows remain `❌`
unless prefix caching is explicitly forced. These values describe the
default engine behavior, not exhaustive model-by-model benchmarking on
Metal. Qwen3 is explicitly covered by the paged prefix-cache e2e test.

`HF AWQ checkpoints`: load through mlx-lm 0.31.3+'s built-in
`_transform_awq_weights` repack. vllm-metal adds an entry-point preflight
that normalizes AutoAWQ aliases (`w_bit`, `q_group_size`, uppercase
`"GEMM"`) and rejects unsupported variants (`gemv`, `bits != 4`,
`group_size != 128`, `zero_point=false`) with a clear error before model
state is constructed, plus a post-load dtype alignment so non-quantized
floating params (embeddings, layernorms, biases) match the engine's
runtime dtype. The preflight, dtype alignment, and
`_transform_awq_weights` repack are architecture-agnostic.
