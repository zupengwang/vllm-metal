"""The runtime contract the GGUF-aware wrappers depend on.

A small, format-neutral protocol so an MLX-native quantized tensor (the only
implementer today, ``GGUFMLXQuantizedTensor``) and a future raw-block/K-quant
tensor can be consumed by the same Linear/Embedding wrappers without
backend-specific dispatch branches. Introduced at the reviewer's request in the
PR 1 review.

This module imports no ``gguf`` and no MLX at runtime — the ``mx`` annotations
are only evaluated under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` — so it stays dependency-light.
